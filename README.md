# media-integrity-checker
Decode the performance. Expose the distortion. Reclaim meaning.

In a world saturated with polished nonsense, Media Integrity Checker is your diagnostic toolkit for cutting through the noise. Whether it’s a corporate press release, a political speech, or a viral thinkpiece, our schema helps you identify the linguistic sleights of hand that mask manipulation, mimic empathy, and inflate virtue.

Built on the principle that performative language is the default mode of distortion, this framework doesn’t just call out BS — it maps its anatomy. From cognitive overload to symbolic saturation, we reveal the tactics used to obscure truth and hijack attention.

This isn’t about cynicism. It’s about clarity.  
Stop reacting. Start decoding.
